# Manage users

A _user_ is defined as any individual who can log in to Grafana. Each user is associated with a _role_ that includes _permissions_. Permissions determine the tasks a user can perform in the system.

For more information about users and permissions, refer to [About users and permissions]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions">}}).
