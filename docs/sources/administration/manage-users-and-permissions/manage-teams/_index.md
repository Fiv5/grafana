# Manage teams

A team is a group of users within an organization that have common dashboard and data source permission needs. For example, instead of assigning five users access to the same dashboard, you can create a team that consists of those users and assign dashboard permissions to the team. A user can belong to multiple teams.

For more information about teams, refer to [Teams and permissions]({{< relref "../about-users-and-permissions/#teams-and-permissions">}}).
